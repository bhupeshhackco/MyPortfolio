Despite my prior experience with Tailwind CSS, this 5-day Devtown bootcamp led by Anshul Ojha significantly improved my styling skills.  Using Tailwind's utility-first classes, the sessions (streamed live on YouTube) concentrated on real-world application—creating responsive user interface elements, layouts, and interactions.  It made it easier for me to comprehend how to expertly organize pages without utilizing custom CSS.  I kept up with everything and used it all in my own portfolio.  The concepts clicked more quickly because of the clarity and practical approach.  Using just HTML + Tailwind to create responsive design made me feel more creative and confident by the end.  My foundation was strengthened by this bootcamp, which also restored the fun of styling!
Bootcamp highlights:
->Reinforced my frontend fundamentals and learned modern UI design using utility-first styling.
->Built multiple sections including responsive navbars, hero layouts, project cards, and forms.
->Explored hover effects, grid layouts, and custom responsiveness with Tailwind’s breakpoints.
->Integrated the concepts into my own portfolio project using only **HTML + Tailwind CSS**.
->Attended all sessions hosted on YouTube and practiced hands-on alongside the mentor.
